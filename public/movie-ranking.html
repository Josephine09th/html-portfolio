<h1> The Best Movie According to Josephine</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time. </h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Passion of Christ</h3>
<p>It is about the journey of Jesus Christ from the Garden of Gethsemane to  Golgotha.<br> This movie never failed to make me cry for it shows God's great love for us through <br/> His passion. It has recently been replaced as a top box office of all time, but Jesus <br/> didn't came to be on top of rating, but to show us His love. </p>
<h3>The Day After Tomorrow</h3>
<p> This is a typical alien invasion type of movie, but the main protagonist has gotten the <br/>chance to reset a day before he got his power. Why I never get tired of watching this <br/> movie is because the lead work hard to have the skills he need to win the invasion and <br/> also knew that he needed support to accompish what is needed to be done. He is not <br/> perfect character,but eventually, he was fully committed to his goal.</p>
<h3>Pride and Prejudice</h3>
<p>This is my favorite romantic movie. The actors played the role and the lines so well<br/> that they made the book look so interesting that I bought the book, but like the movie better.<br/> The movie is like you are doing a picture reading. I also loved the places were the movie <br/>was filmed. Hopefully, I get to see it in person too. </p>
